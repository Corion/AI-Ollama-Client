=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 C<< format >>

The format to return a response in. Currently the only accepted value is json.

Enable JSON mode by setting the format parameter to json. This will structure the response as valid JSON.

Note: it's important to instruct the model to use JSON in the prompt. Otherwise, the model may generate large amounts whitespace.

=cut

has 'format' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Enum[
        "json",
    ],
);

=head2 C<< keep_alive >>

How long (in minutes) to keep the model loaded in memory.

- If set to a positive duration (e.g. 20), the model will stay loaded for the provided duration.
- If set to a negative duration (e.g. -1), the model will stay loaded indefinitely.
- If set to 0, the model will be unloaded immediately once finished.
- If not set, the model will stay loaded for 5 minutes by default

=cut

has 'keep_alive' => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Int,
);

The model name.

Model names follow a `model:tag` format. Some examples are `orca-mini:3b-q4_1` and `llama2:70b`. The tag is optional and, if not provided, will default to `latest`. The tag is used to identify a specific version.

    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => Str,
    required => 1,
);

=head2 C<< options >>

Additional model parameters listed in the documentation for the Modelfile such as `temperature`.

    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => HashRef,
);

=head2 C<< stream >>

If `false` the response will be returned as a single response object, otherwise the response will be streamed as a series of objects.

has 'stream' => (
    is       => 'ro',
